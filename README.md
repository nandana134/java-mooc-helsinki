## 📌 Notes

- All exercise logic/code was written by me.
- The surrounding project scaffolding was provided by the MOOC platform.
- I’ve preserved the structure to reflect the original testing environment.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Completing this course gave me hands-on experience in writing clean, modular Java code, understanding OOP, debugging, and solving real-world logic problems. It’s a solid foundation for advanced Java development, backend engineering, and software design.
